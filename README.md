ACLB - Adaptive Cognitive Load Balancer
A Chrome extension that monitors cognitive load and enhances focus through intelligent browsing assistance.

Overview
ACLB addresses digital cognitive overload by providing real-time focus monitoring and proactive intervention. Unlike traditional website blockers that use restrictive measures, ACLB employs behavioral analytics and AI-powered assistance to help users maintain optimal focus during browsing sessions.

Core Features
Cognitive Load Monitoring
Real-time Focus Scoring: Continuous assessment of cognitive load with intuitive scoring (lower scores indicate better focus)

Behavioral Pattern Analysis: Tracks reading depth, tab switching frequency, and engagement metrics

Distraction Analytics: Identifies and categorizes primary distraction sources with impact percentages

Connection Health Monitoring: Ensures reliable extension performance with status indicators

Focus Enhancement Tools
Adaptive Focus Mode: Multi-level distraction blocking with visual, light, medium, and heavy intensity options

Universal Element Picker: Point-and-click interface to hide distracting elements across any website

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Verified functionality on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and major news platforms

Persistent Configuration: User-defined blocks remain effective across browsing sessions

Intelligent Assistance
AI-Powered Summarization: Leverages Chrome's built-in AI for content condensation during high cognitive load

Personalized Focus Plans: Generates tailored recommendations based on individual browsing patterns

Context-Aware Interventions: Proactive assistance triggered by focus score thresholds

Trend Analysis: Seven-day focus pattern visualization and distraction source tracking
